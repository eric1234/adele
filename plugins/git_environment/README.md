# Git Worktree Environment

The stock Git Environment backend establishes a Task-specific linked worktree
and normally creates a flat Task-derived branch. It accepts only local `file:`
Project source URIs that resolve to usable Git worktrees. If that source selects
a repository subdirectory, the live Environment remains rooted at the matching
subdirectory in the linked worktree.

## Placement and retained state

Provider-owned Task worktrees live at
`<Project.sourceLocation>/.adele/worktrees/<allocated-name>`, alongside the stock
Local Directory Project's `.adele/data.db`. The selected Project source is resolved
canonically before allocation. This is stock Git provider policy, not a universal
Environment storage path or a dependency on application-private Project storage.
Task/Environment-derived branch and worktree names retain deterministic collision
suffixes; the parent namespace no longer includes an absolute-source-path hash.

For a source such as `repository/selected/project`, the full linked checkout is
under `repository/selected/project/.adele/worktrees/<allocated-name>`. Its live
Environment root is the corresponding `selected/project` directory inside that
checkout, not the checkout root or original Project source.

Provider-state schema **v2** contains exactly these fields, stored opaquely by core:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `schemaVersion` | Integer `2`; v1 is not accepted. |
| `environmentId` | Exact retained Environment identity. |
| `sourceRelativePath` | Selected source relative to its Git worktree root, using forward slashes; empty for a repository-root source. |
| `worktreeRelativePath` | Project-source-relative `.adele/worktrees/<allocated-name>`, using forward slashes. |
| `branch` | Exact provider-created Task branch. |
| `baselineCommit` | Exact full commit identity at establishment. |

The old absolute `sourcePath`, `repositoryPath`, `commonGitDirectory`, and
`worktreePath` fields are absent, not retained as diagnostics or restoration
authority. Development reports can derive current absolute paths separately.
State validation rejects missing/extra fields, incorrect types/versions, mismatched
Environment identity, invalid Git identities, and malformed relative paths.
Storage paths cannot be absolute, traversing, URI-shaped, or backslash-separated.
Existing storage parent components and the worktree root must be direct canonical
directories beneath the selected source; symbolic links are rejected even when
they target another in-source directory. Only establishment creates storage parents.
Neither establishment nor restoration edits `.gitignore` or `.git/info/exclude`;
ignore ergonomics for local operational state remain separate policy work.

## Restoration and moves

Restoration uses the **current** canonical Project source and relative v2 state.
The selected source must still have the exact retained source-relative scope.
Git's `worktree list --porcelain -z` inventory identifies the registration for the
retained exact branch. Healthy registration at the expected path needs no repair.
If that registration points elsewhere, the expected in-Project worktree must
already exist and the old registered path must be absent before it is a relocation
candidate. An existing old path, including a symbolic link, is an explicit conflict:
the provider does not steal/repoint another live checkout or resolve Project copies.

Only a relocation candidate runs `git worktree repair <new-worktree-path>` from the
current source repository context. Before repair, the provider checks the candidate's
Git metadata identity and every other existing linked registration: Git's repair
command can also rewrite their checkout markers. Foreign, aliased, broken, or
ambiguous live registrations therefore fail closed rather than being incidentally
repaired. A stale candidate's bounded, documented checkout `.git` marker can identify
the metadata directory Git would infer; Git commands and inventory validate that
identity. Private `.git/worktrees` registration contents are not parsed.
The provider re-reads the inventory and requires
the retained branch at the expected path. Repair success alone is not authority:
the provider then validates the actual linked worktree, current common Git
directory, exact branch, exact baseline commit, and confined selected source scope
before binding a fresh `WorktreeEnvironment`. Successful restoration returns
canonical relative v2 state, normally unchanged by a move.

A missing worktree fails explicitly. Restore never creates a replacement
Environment, branch, worktree, or collision suffix. Unsupported/failed repair
returns an Environment failure with bounded Git diagnostics. There is no global
Git-version preflight: same-location restoration does not require repair support.
Creation uses ordinary linked worktrees, not `--relative-paths`,
`worktree.useRelativePaths`, or `extensions.relativeWorktrees`. Repair-based
relocation intentionally accommodates commonly shipped LTS Git versions without
requiring Git 2.48+; native relative worktrees may replace it in a later migration.

Provider Git processes retain the ordinary host environment while repository-local
Git routing variables are removed. Each backend generation reconstructs live
objects in its own registry; shutdown terminates active foreground executions and
clears those objects without removing Git worktrees. Failed establishment publishes
nothing and performs best-effort branch/worktree cleanup only with sufficient
ownership evidence and revalidated confined storage paths.

This supports explicitly retained state across provider generations and whole-Project
moves. **Core does not yet persist or automatically reload Task/Environment records
or provider state across application restart.** Project database reopening alone
does not restore Environments.

## Filesystem and processes

The current filesystem surface is bounded UTF-8 `readFile` with opaque
provider-produced revisions, create-new-only `createTextFile`, conditional
replacement and deletion of existing text files using expected revisions, and
bounded deterministic direct-child `readDirectory`. Search and model-tool
semantics are intentionally not provider methods: stock tool plugins compose
lower-level Environment operations. Current text-file reads and mutations
require direct confined paths and reject a symbolic link in either the terminal
file or any parent component. Creation requires the parent directory to exist
and never creates directories implicitly.

On Linux x64, the provider also implements the Environment foreground-process
stream with direct `program` plus `arguments` execution, no implicit shell,
required timeouts from 1 through 600 seconds, and a resolved cwd confined to the
Environment root. A cwd may use an in-Environment directory symlink when its
resolved target remains confined. stdout and stderr are incrementally decoded
as UTF-8 with malformed sequences replaced and are emitted as separately tagged
text chunks. Each stream retains/emits at most 1 MiB using an immediate head and
a bounded tail; discarded middle output is still drained, and independent
truncation flags accompany completion.

Foreground execution uses the trusted system `setsid` supplied by util-linux.
The provider owns the resulting process group and uses SIGTERM followed by a
short SIGKILL escalation for timeout, stream cancellation, normal leader exit,
and provider shutdown. This prevents ordinary descendants from accidentally
outliving the invocation. A deliberately daemonizing process can escape an
ordinary process group, so this is practical lifetime ownership rather than an
OS sandbox or cgroup/pidfd-strength containment.

The provider rejects missing and non-executable programs before spawn. The
stock Dart process API confirms the internal `setsid` launch rather than the
subsequent `exec` handoff, so a rare post-check handoff failure (for example a
concurrent executable replacement) can surface as launcher exit 126/127. ADELE
does not reinterpret all 126/127 results because those are also valid program
exit codes.

Environment child processes use `includeParentEnvironment: false`. The current
allowlist retains `PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `LOGNAME`, `SHELL`, `LANG`, `LANGUAGE`,
`TZ`, temporary-directory variables, selected `XDG_*` directory variables, and
all `LC_*` variables. The provider sets canonical `PWD` and `TERM=dumb`. Other
variables, including every inherited `ADELE_*`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GIT_*`, and
`SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, are omitted. This reduces accidental backend credential and
Git-routing leakage, but same-user filesystem, process, credential-helper, and
network access remain outside this hygiene boundary.

Create, replace, and delete operations share one mutation serialization tail
within each live Environment. Replacement is staged beside the direct confined
target and rechecked immediately before promotion; POSIX rwx permission bits are
preserved. Creation stages complete bytes and revalidates the direct parent and
target absence. Windows uses its no-replace rename behavior directly; platforms
whose rename replaces a destination first use an exclusive empty-file
reservation. ADELE therefore never intentionally overwrites an existing target,
and coordinated duplicate creates cannot both succeed. Deletion performs
bounded direct-file reads and revision checks twice before unlinking. Dart
exposes neither a portable no-replace promotion nor atomic compare-and-delete,
so an arbitrary external process can still race the final promotion/unlink
windows. These are practical local guarantees, not filesystem transactions or
crash/power-loss durability. A rare failure after a POSIX reservation but before
promotion can leave an empty target: the provider cleans its private staging
directory but does not delete that pathname because Dart cannot prove an
external process has not replaced it.

Directory/move/copy/binary mutation, general create-or-overwrite semantics,
command-specific policy/classification, background or persistent processes,
stdin/PTY support, release/destruction, and remote cloning remain absent. The
separate stock Command Tools plugin projects this provider-neutral foreground
surface as model-facing `run_command`; that does not move tool or policy
semantics into this provider.

Path canonicalization, direct-component symlink rejection for file access,
resolved-directory confinement for process cwd, and post-resolution validation
provide application-level confinement equivalent to the historical
DevelopmentSource proof. They are not an operating-system sandbox and cannot
eliminate every pathname replacement race against another local process.
